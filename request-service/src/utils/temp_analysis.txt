const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// We are defining a minimal Donor schema here to interact with the 'donors' collection
// residing in the 'blood-donation-donor' database.
//
// In a microservices architecture, ideally, we should interact via API calls.
// However, since we are exploring Mongoose cross-db access or simplified local dev,
// we might not have direct access to the other DB connection unless we configure it.
//
// STOP: The user said "Query Donor model". In strict microservices, Request Service 
// doesn't have access to Donor DB. 
//
// OPTION A: Synchronous HTTP Call to Donor Service (Best Practice for Microservices isolation)
// OPTION B: Direct DB Access (If user implies shared cluster/hack).
// 
// Given the user prompt context "Query Donor model using...", and the structure shows separate folders.
// But usually in these refined tutorials, people often use separate connections or just mock it.
//
// Let's look at config/db.js to see how connection is handled.
// If typical mongoose.connect is used, it connects to ONE db.
// Request service connects to 'blood-donation-request'.
// Donor service connects to 'blood-donation-donor'.
//
// To query Donors from Request Service, we need to either:
// 1. Make an HTTP request to Donor Service (localhost:5002)
// 2. Open a second mongoose connection to 'blood-donation-donor'
//
// I will implement a Helper to make HTTP internal requests, OR if the user simplified it 
// and logic implies strict code interpretation "Query Donor model", I might need to simulate/stub it 
// or check if I can assume shared DB.
//
// Let's pause and check how `db.js` is set up.
